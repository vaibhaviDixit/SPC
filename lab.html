	<h2 style="font-size:.8em;text-align: justify-all;">Name of the laboratory: Computer Fundamental Lab</h2>
	<p >In a layman language, a computer is a fast calculating device that can perform arithmetic. Although the computer was originally invented mainly for doing high speed and accurate calculations, it is not just a calculating device. It gets the data through an input device, processes it as per the instructions given and information as output. We can define a computer follows. "A computer is fast electronic device that processes the input data according to the instructions given by the programmer/user and provides the desired information as output". Term Meaning Data A set of basic facts and entities which itself has no Meaning. Information Data which has some meaning or value. Instruction A statement given to computer to perform a task Input Data and Instructions given to computer Process Manipulation of data output Information obtained after processing of data 2. Importance of Computer Computer plays a vital role for processing of data in an organization. Computers help in processing volumes of data efficiently and accurately within short time. A computer has the following characteristics, which makes it so important for an organization: 1. Fast: A computer is so fast that it can perform the given task (arithmetical of logical) in few seconds as compared to man who can spend many months for doing the same task. A computer can process millions of instruction per second. 2. Accurate: While doing calculations, a computer is more accurate than a man. Man can make mistakes in calculations but a computer does not, if it is provided with accurate instruction. 3. High Memory: A computer has much more memory of storage capacity than human beings. It can store millions of data and instructions, which can be retrieved and recalled even after number of years. This in not possible in cast of human brain.</p>
